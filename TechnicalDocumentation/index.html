            HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
            documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
            content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
            technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
            languages such as JavaScript.
          </li>
          <li>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
            storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML
            describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
            included cues for its appearance.
          </li>
          <li>
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
            constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may
            be embedded into the rendered page.
          </li>
          <li>
            HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
            structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
            links, quotes, and other items.HTML elements are delineated by tags,
            written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;img&gt; and
            &lt;input&gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags
            such as &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; surround and provide information
            about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do
            not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of
            the page.
          </li>
          <li>
            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as
            JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The
            inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World
            Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current
            maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over
            explicit presentational HTML since 1997. A form of HTML, known as
            HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the
            &lt;canvas&gt; element, together with JavaScript.

            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
            specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a
            markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as
            SVG, MathML or XHTML).
          </li>
          <li>
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and
            presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation
            can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and
            control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable
            multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant
            CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition
            in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to
            improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file
            and its formatting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to
            present the same markup page in different styles for different
            rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
            speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile
            devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content
            is accessed on a mobile device.
          </li>
          <li>
            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to
            determine which declaration applies if more than one declaration of
            a property match a particular element. This cascading priority
            scheme is predictable.

          JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and
          core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites
          use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the
          client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a
          variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage
          is Node.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
          conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing,
          prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
          multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
          programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
          for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
          structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
        </p>
        <p>
          The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such
          as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web
          browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

        <header>Front-End Web Development</header>
        <p>
          Front-end development primarily focuses on user experience. Using the
          related coding and design techniques, you as front-end developers
          build the elements of an application that are directly accessed by
          end-users with a goal of rendering the entire interface elegant, easy
          to use, fast, and secure, fostering user engagement and interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of creating an engaging user interface, front end app
          development often focus on specific design elements such as text
          colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, and overall
          color schemes. These elements play a crucial role in enhancing the
          visual appeal and user-friendliness of the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Front end app development encompasses various interactive elements
          like sliders, pop-up forms, and custom interactive maps. An essential
          part of a front end application are navigational menus, which guide
          users through the application, enhancing their overall experience and
          interaction with the website or application. The creation of intuitive
          and user-friendly navigational menus is a key skill for front-end
          developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Front-end developers require a specific set of skills to effectively
          create user interfaces. This includes proficiency in coding languages
          like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as a strong understanding of
          CSS preprocessors such as Sass and Less. In terms of career
          requirements, aspiring front-end developers often pursue a degree in
          Computer Science or a related field, although this is not always a
          mandatory requirement. A strong foundational understanding and
          proficiency in coding languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
          increasingly, jQuery, are essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, an understanding of server-side CSS processing
          techniques and their applications in web development is beneficial. In
          terms of CSS, front-end developers must also be adept at styling text,
          including choosing appropriate colors and styles to ensure readability
          and enhance user engagement. They should also be skilled in
          TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, which adds static typing
          abilities to the language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to the latest design and technology trends geared for the front
          end, you can build increasingly more sophisticated designs and
          interaction patterns. Simultaneously, however, more complexity
          results, so much so that front-end web development has become a
          specialized field that requires deep expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Front end applications, also known as the “client side” of an
          application, are what users see and interact with. They differ from
          the backend, which is like the hidden machinery behind the scenes. In
          this context, APIs act as translators, ensuring seamless communication
          between the visually rich front-end and the complex backend.
        </p>
        <p>
          The major trend in front-end development in recent years is the growth
          of applications for mobile and smart devices, with users accessing
          applications from a growing number of devices with different screen
          sizes and interaction options. As a result, front-end developers must
          ensure their application delivers a consistent, high-quality user
          experience for all devices and usage scenarios. That’s a daunting
          challenge.

        <p>
          Back-end development means working on server-side software, which
          focuses on everything you can’t see on a website. Back-end developers
          ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end
          logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and
          servers. They use code that helps browsers communicate with databases,
          store, understand, and delete data.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a team, back-end developers collaborate with front-end developers,
          product managers, principal architects, and website testers to build
          the structure of a website or mobile app. Back-end developers must be
          familiar with many kinds of tools and frameworks, including languages
          such as Python, Java, and Ruby. They make sure the back-end performs
          quickly and responsively to front-end user requests.
