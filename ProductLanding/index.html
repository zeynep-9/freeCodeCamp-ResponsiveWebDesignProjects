          <h6>General Information</h6>
          <p>
            GPT-4o ("GPT-4 Omni") is a multilingual, multimodal generative
            pre-trained transformer designed by OpenAI. It was announced by
            OpenAI's CTO Mira Murati during a live-streamed demo on 13 May 2024
            and released the same day. GPT-4o is free, but with a usage limit
            that is 5 times higher for ChatGPT Plus subscribers. It can process
            and generate text, images and audio. Its API is twice as fast and
            half the price of its predecessor, GPT-4 Turbo.
          </p>
          <h6>Background</h6>
          <p>
            GPT-4o was originally shadow launched on the Large Model Systems
            Organization (LMSYS) as 3 different models. These 3 models were
            called gpt2-chatbot, im-a-good-gpt2-chatbot, and
            im-also-a-good-gpt2-chatbot. On 7 May 2024, Sam Altman tweeted
            "im-a-good-gpt2-chatbot", which was commonly interpreted as a
            confirmation that these were new OpenAI models being A/B tested.
          </p>

        <div class="info">
          <h6>Capabilities</h6>
          <p>
            GPT-4o achieved state-of-the-art results in voice, multilingual, and
            vision benchmarks, setting new records in audio speech recognition
            and translation. GPT-4o scored 88.7 on the Massive Multitask
            Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark compared to 86.5 by GPT-4.
            Unlike GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, which rely on other models to process
            sound, GPT-4o natively supports voice-to-voice, making the response
            nearly instant and seamless. Sam Altman noted on 15 May 2024 that
            GPT-4o's voice-to-voice capabilities were not yet integrated into
            ChatGPT, and that the old version was still being used.
          </p>
          <p>
            The model supports over 50 languages, which OpenAI claims cover over
            97% of speakers. Mira Murati demonstrated the model's multilingual
            capability by speaking Italian to the model and having it translate
            between English and Italian during the live-streamed OpenAI demo
            event on 13 May 2024. In addition, the new tokenizer uses fewer
            tokens for certain languages, especially languages that are not
            based on the Latin alphabet, making it cheaper for those languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            GPT-4o has knowledge up to October 2023 and has a context length of
            128k tokens with output token limit capped to 2048. As of May 2024,
            it is the leading model in the Large Model Systems Organization
            (LMSYS) Elo Arena Benchmarks by the University of California,
            Berkeley.
